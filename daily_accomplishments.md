## Day 1 — January 26, 2026

### Focus

Foundations: problem-solving + system design

### Accomplishments

- Solved several LeetCode problems to sharpen algorithmic thinking and logic.
- Started canvassing and planning for our group project Aralify (a Sololearn-like learning platform).
- Designed and completed a **text-based system architecture** for Code Forge.
- Began creating the **Logical and Physical ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)** for the system.

### Key Learnings

- System design is easier when starting from core entities and user flows.
- Translating ideas into architecture forces clarity in assumptions.

### Tools / Tech Used

- LeetCode
- Notion
- ERD tools (conceptual)

### Reflection

This day felt like laying the foundation of a building. No UI yet, no fancy features—just structure and logic. But this is where real systems begin.

## Day 2 — January 27, 2026

### Focus

Onboarding + solidifying database design

### Accomplishments

- Attended onboarding meeting led by our DevOps engineer **John Layda**.
- Learned about team workflow, expectations, and development pipeline.
- Finished both **Logical and Physical ERD** for Arlify.

### Key Learnings

- DevOps is not just deployment—it’s about communication, automation, and reliability.
- A well-designed ERD makes backend development significantly easier.

### Tools / Tech Used

- Notion
- ERD tools
- Internal onboarding materials

### Reflection

This day shifted from solo thinking to team thinking. Understanding how developers collaborate in real environments feels like stepping into the "real world" of software engineering.

## Ongoing Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills through daily coding challenges.
- Translate system design into real backend implementation.
- Learn industry practices (DevOps, collaboration, documentation).

## Day 3 — January 28, 2026

### Focus

Tooling, architecture decisions, and team structure

### Accomplishments

- Conducted canvassing and evaluation of libraries and frameworks for Aralify(Sololearn-like system).
- Established the **main repository** for the project and connected it with the team’s **Discord** for centralized collaboration.
- Started setting up **AI tools and agent skills** to assist development, guidance, and documentation.
    - Included integrations and workflows involving **AI guides**, **Claude**, **Cursor**, and **diagram-generation tools**.
- Learned about **design tokens** and their role in maintaining UI consistency across platforms.
- Assigned to work specifically on the **mobile application** side of Aralify.
- Started creating a **mobile app sitemap** for Aralify using **Figma** to map screens and user flows.

### Key Learnings

- Early tooling decisions have long-term impact on developer velocity and maintainability.
- Design tokens act as a single source of truth for UI—bridging design and development.
- AI tools are most powerful when treated as collaborators, not replacements.

### Tools / Tech Used

- Git & GitHub
- Discord
- AI tools (Claude, Cursor, diagram agents)
- UI design concepts (design tokens)

### Reflection

This day felt like moving from planning into real-world execution. Setting up repos, tools, and AI workflows made the project feel *alive*. Being assigned to the mobile app also clarified my role and responsibility within the team.
